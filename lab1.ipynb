    "### Useful Terminal Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the terminal to navigate through your computerâ€™s file system and run various applications. Windows users should use Git Bash (search for it in Start Menu), while Mac/Linux Users should open their terminals. Here are some useful commands that you should be familiar with (try them out!):\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```pwd```  - shows the path of your current directory (i.e. tells you where you are)\n",
    "on Windows, the terminal prompt contains the path of your current directory\n",
    "- ```ls``` shows what is in the current directory\n",
    "- ```cd <directory or path> ``` - change directory to the specified directory (**NOTE**: the use of the greater than and less than signs are meant to indicate that you need to type in whatever directory or path you want to go to. You should not literally type in these symbols into the terminal)\n",
    "\t-\t```cd ..``` goes up one level, to the parent folder\n",
    "\t- *extra tip*: TAB does autocomplete for file names (start typing the name of a file/folder and press TAB before you finish typing)\n",
    " \t- You can use the symbol ```~```as shorthand for your home directory. So for example ```cd ~/Desktop``` will probably get you to your desktop if you're on Mac/Linux. **Note**: This references an *absolute* path rather than a *relative* path -- it points directly to your home directory regardless of what directory you are currently in, rather than some place relative to the current directory you are in. The rest of the time when you use cd to navigate around you are usually specifying relative paths (path relative to where you are right now).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tChose a folder where you want to save your work for this assignment.\n",
    "2.\tOpen Atom, and write the following code:\n",
    "```print test successful!``` and then go to *File -> Save As* and save the file with the extensiion ```.py``` in the directory you chose. For example, I saved the file as *test.py*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tNow, in terminal, navigate to that folder using the commands you learned above.\n",
    "4.\tOnce you are there, type:\n",
    "```python <program name>.py ```. In this case, we type ```python test.py```. You should now see ```test successful!``` in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do a lot more with a terminal. See software carpentry's [resources](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) on this.\n",
